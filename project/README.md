# Ensemble Prediction Systems: Labs and projects

This is the repository for my lab assignments and final project for [ATM S 544](https://myplan.uw.edu/course/#/courses/ATM%20S544) at the University of Washington. The course focuses on ensemble data assimilation and is taught by Greg Hakim (UW) and Chris Snyder (NCAR).

For my project, I reproduced some results of [Perkins & Hakim (2021)](https://doi.org/10.1029/2020PA003959), who reconstructed climate fields over the last millennium using linear inverse models and ensemble-based paleoclimate data assimilation.
